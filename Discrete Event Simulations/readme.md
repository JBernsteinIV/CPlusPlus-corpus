# Mobile Switching Center project

This project is an event-based network simulation for a Mobile Switching Center. If you're unfamiliar with MSCs, they are base stations that manage wireless signal clusters (allowed frequencies in a geographic scope).

One of two input files is used to calculate the average grade of service for a simulated phone call and the simulation also utilizes three separate clusters.
