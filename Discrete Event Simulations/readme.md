# Mobile Switching Center project

This project is an event-based network simulation for a Mobile Switching Center. If you're unfamiliar with MSCs, they are base stations that manage wireless signal clusters (allowed frequencies in a geographic scope).

One of two input files is used to calculate the average grade of service for a simulated phone call and the simulation also utilizes three separate clusters.

Note: I lazily made the file path to the input files based off of where they were on my computer. So you will need to modify the string input in Source.cpp's Simulate() constructor to get it to work properly.
